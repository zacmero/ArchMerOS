## Changing Themes

Press **F1** → **Themes** to cycle through available themes. Your selection is saved automatically.

## Custom Themes

Create custom themes by placing TOML files in:

- `/usr/share/sysc-greet/themes/` (system-wide)
- `~/.config/sysc-greet/themes/` (user)

Custom themes appear in F1 → Themes alongside built-in themes.

### Format

```toml
# my-theme.toml
name = "My Theme"

[colors]
bg_base = "#1a1a2e"
bg_active = "#2a2a3e"
primary = "#e94560"
secondary = "#0f3460"
accent = "#16213e"
warning = "#f59e0b"
danger = "#ef4444"
fg_primary = "#ffffff"
fg_secondary = "#cccccc"
fg_muted = "#888888"
border_focus = "#e94560"
```

All color fields are required. Use hex format (`#RRGGBB`).

An example theme is provided in the repository at `examples/themes/example.toml`.

### Generating Wallpapers

After adding a new theme, regenerate wallpapers to include theme-matched backgrounds:

```bash
cd scripts/
python3 generate-wallpapers.py
```

This creates wallpapers for all themes in `/usr/share/sysc-greet/wallpapers/`. See [Wallpapers](../features/wallpapers.md) for more options.

### Background Effects

Custom themes automatically work with all background effects (fire, matrix, rain, fireworks). The effects generate color palettes from your theme's colors:

- **Fire** uses `bg_base` → `warning` → `danger` → `primary` gradient
- **Matrix** uses `bg_base` → `secondary` → `primary` for the falling characters
- **Rain** uses `primary`, `secondary`, `accent` for the drops
- **Fireworks** uses all accent colors for variety

No additional configuration needed - just select your custom theme and enable an effect.

### TTY Compatibility

sysc-greet uses the `colorprofile` library to detect terminal capabilities and fall back gracefully:

- **TrueColor terminals** - Full 24-bit color support
- **ANSI256 terminals** - 256-color palette support
- **Basic TTY** - Falls back to basic ANSI 16 colors

This ensures consistent appearance across different terminal emulators and TTY.
